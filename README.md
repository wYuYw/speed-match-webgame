# Project Details

## 1. Customer

- My studymates

## 2. Key Considerations

### Make it simple, but addictive

1. The game should not be too complicated nor have too much variables. It has to be simple enough that customers can shortly take a break while hard studying. It doesn't need complicate strategy but just speed.

2. The game should be fun and addictive, so that it can release customers' stress for further study. For this, I choose space-feeling design for fancy UI. Also, it is designed to be able to compete with friends by storing the scores as rankings in localstorage.

## 3. Structure

### Main

- Nickname input
